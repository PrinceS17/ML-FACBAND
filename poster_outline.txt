1. Introduction
2. Problem definition
	- correct the proposal: fast, comprehensive, deployment
	- our basic procedure: deploy on router/collector, real-time detection, general anomaly
3. Data processing
 1) feature extraction
	- 37 features
	- temporal figures: [fig: in mid-pre]
 2) dataset
	- data access: RIPE, bgpstream/broker [fig:logos]
	- anomaly labeling: bgpstream.com: mention this doesn't apply to real-time, local case
4. Training & test
   1)	tools: weka
	goals: worm -> worm
	algorithms: SMO, logicBoost, NB
	results: [fig]
   2)	tools: pytorch: 
	goals: general -> general
	algorithms: DL, (xgboost)
	results: [fig]
5. conclusion
	- which is best
6. future work
	- admit some drawbacks
